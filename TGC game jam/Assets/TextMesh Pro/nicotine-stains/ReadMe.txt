NICOTINE STAINS
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

I've only done a few "stressed" fonts (fonts created by taking scans or bitmaps of traditional type and whacking 'em repeatedly with a lead pipe), but I remain fascinated by the artform (an artform often dismissed as artless by some creators of pure-math type). Living in Austin, where live music is a very serious part of the local culture and economy, I see new posters for local bands plastered on walls, posts and other surfaces nearly every day, and the kinds of people who make bar-band posters love a good stressed font. So do I!

Nicotine Stains is the result of continual exposure to these things, I guess, and what amounts to a dirty little thrill from seeing nice, clean, symmetrical type thrashed and mangled. I regard myself as a knight in whatever army opposes the symmetrical and regular things in the world, a champion of the rumpled, the worn, the comfortably lived-in and casually discarded. Nothing makes me more nervous than visiting the house of somebody who keeps the plastic wrappers on their lampshades. . .


Nicotine Stains is a full keyboard set with my usual smattering of extended characters thrown in. Advertise your band today!
